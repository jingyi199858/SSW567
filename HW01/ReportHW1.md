<h4>What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any?</h4> 
The way to classify right triangle. Simplest way to
classify right triangles is to only classify 
Pythagorean triples which has three positive 
integers a, b, and c, such that a^2 + b^2 = c^2. 
Others would be classified as scalene. However, 
we can include errors that helps define right triangles
that have float length side.

<h4>What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?</h4>
Overall precise except that might need to 
have more requirements toward the classification of 
right triangles.

<h4>What challenges did you encounter with the tools?</h4>
Not quite. Unittest is well running in my local machine
MacOSX. It might need more configuration running with Linux 
environment, or need to switch to pytest.

<h4>Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?</h4>
Except the base case where any of the sides has zero length.
Then the rest cases are following the definitions.
